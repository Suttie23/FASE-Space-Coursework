# FASE Space Coursework

In this coursework, you will have to design a control system for a space station. You will then create Ada-SPARK specifications and bodies for your system, along with a justifications using a graphical representation of the safety case in Goal Structuring Notation. A report, containing your specification definitions and descriptions, must be produced that is no longer than 10-pages in the LNCS style template. These templates are made availabe for you on Moodle


## Overview

Outer space is hazardous to human health. Lots of effort, on the part of various space agencies, goes towards ensuring that humans can go to, and return from, space safely. In this coursework, you are going to design the control system for an orbiting space station. You need only use what you have learnt in this module. You will develop a control system for a 3-person modular space station. This system will prevent certain actions when they are unsafe. For example, airlock doors should not be open at the same time; the space station should maintain orbit height (within a narrow range); and so on. In particular:

– It is not the case that both airlock doors are open at the same time.

– The space station should come neither too close to, nor get too far away from, Earth.

– New space station modules are added on a first-in-last-out basis.

– When a space walk is attempted by a crew member, the other two crew members must be monitoring from opposite ends of the station.
